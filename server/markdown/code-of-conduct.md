# Ionic Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Ionic project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of Ionic's channels (GitHub, Slack, Forum, IRC, mailing lists, Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the Ionic project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Ionic project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.


If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at [hi@ionicframework.com](mailto:hi@ionicframework.com).


## Ionic Events

Adapted from the JSConf Code Of Conduct (http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html)

All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any Ionic run/sanctioned event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

The Quick Version

Ionic is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please email us at [devrel@ionic.io](mailto:devrel@ionic.io).
