For further detail on our plans, please our response to common questions below:

Does Ionic have a contingency plan for COVID-19?

Effective March 2, 2020, Ionic began taking precautions to ensure the health and safety of our employees, who are at the core of everything we do. Our history of embracing remote work has made the transition to a fully remote environment seamless. While this does impact some planned events, we expect the impact of our response to COVID-19 on our business services to be minimal. We also offer extended sick leave to any employees should they need it and we have suspended business travel indefinitely. We will continue to comply with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) and our local health authorities and will change our policies as appropriate.

We are committed to lessening the potential spread of the virus in our communities, to supporting our employees and their families, and to ensuring we are able to continue serving our customers long-term. Our leadership team will continue to assess the situation in real time and will remain vigilant in our ability to accommodate the evolving environment.
