We encourage you to be aware when leaving our Services and to read the privacy statements of External Web Sites that collect your personal information.

<span id="Security" class="anchor"></span>**10. SECURITY**

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we employ procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help safeguard the information we collect. Only authorized Ionic personnel have access to the personal information, including server logs and cookie utilization data, that we collect. These individuals are required to follow strict security policies and procedures. Ionic may use encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection and other physical and logical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to such. Ionic may also place internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We do not warrant or represent that personal information about you will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.

If you use the Services, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password. You are responsible for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password. We cannot secure any personal information that you release on your own, that you request us to release or that is released through another third party to whom you’ve given access.

Where required under applicable law or by contract, we will notify the appropriate parties or individuals of any loss, misuse or alteration of personal information so that such parties or individuals can take the appropriate actions for the due protection of their rights. If such personal information is information of an Ionic customer, we will notify such customer and coordinate with them regarding any required notices to particular individuals.

With respect to Europe, we comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as described in our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Privacy Policy, which supplements this policy, and may also use standard data protection clauses adopted by supervisory authorities and approved by the European Commission to safeguard transfers.
