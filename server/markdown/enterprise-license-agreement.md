	2.3  Exclusions.  Drifty shall have no support obligations with respect to any hardware or software product other than the Drifty Software ("Nonqualified Products").  If Drifty provides Technical Support for a problem caused by a Nonqualified Product, or if Drifty’s service efforts are increased as a result of a Nonqualified Product, and upon notification to Client, Drifty may charge time and materials for such extra services at its then current rates.  If, in Drifty’s reasonable opinion, performance of Technical Support is or will be made more difficult or impaired because of Nonqualified Products, Drifty shall so notify Client, and Client shall immediately remove the Nonqualified Product at its own risk and expense.  Client shall remain solely responsible for the compatibility and functioning of nonqualified products with the Drifty Software.

In connection with providing the maintenance and Technical Support described in this Schedule, Client shall have the following responsibilities:  (1) maintain the Nonqualified Products and associated peripheral equipment if any, in good working order in accordance with the manufacturers’ specifications, and insure that any problems reported to Drifty are not due to hardware or operating system malfunction; (2) supply Drifty with access to and use of all information and facilities determined to be necessary by Drifty to render the Technical Support described in this Agreement; (3) perform any tests or procedures recommended by Drifty for the purpose of identifying and/or resolving any problems; (4) maintain a procedure external to the Drifty Software for reconstruction of lost or altered files, data, or programs; (5) at all times follow routine operator procedures as specified in the Documentation; and (6) ensure that the Drifty Software is isolated from any process links or anything else that could cause harm before requesting or receiving remote support assistance.
