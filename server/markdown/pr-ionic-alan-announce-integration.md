[Alan](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tS4FW8fF60m1JTlSMDdOd5sky7Srq6pto0QrIKuyugMyyw6IgQqxuw5-deL1D1J1)  and  [Ionic](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HLkz7WU8tWS8PkgtpabyqYq5i3HEhsehB8_XoIWApK-B_QfdQuYUihpz9QonqH8mZl71e2JnQC6AWxwdgcmrAw==)  today announced they have  [integrated their platforms](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7e5j6xOTNkUkCsXuRjoIylv6tTKhvta6PIIPWbseuLVmAJcvUFhq0woaYJ_p4Wu4EVrJrv3-he9vJRTUSlW9mPillhozS9jmeicwCISHiDPw0V5v7Pge3PVQU-5vFoVR)  to enable millions of developers worldwide to add natural conversational voice for Ionic applications.  

Today, applications are limited by mobile screen sizes: developers and designers are limited in the data and actions they are able to represent on screens, leading to increased friction and complex end-user experiences. Even after a decade of mobile evolution, most applications are hard to use, hard to learn, and take a long time to change. Adding voice to an application presents unlimited functionality, allowing users the ability to get started with zero training, with easily updatable interfaces. Alan is starting to transform applications in  [field maintenance](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QF9SVvApnKeb7CR5kwZqHjQhhfguW1W_9n3N0zcsQXl8b6CpyNTSbiden7pM_LqKnajZe-04Ee9IKw3XhsGPvcOgUpcpYAawatx_XpYhxAA=), retail, finance,  [public safety](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QjGIGyLgnWscs6kGSBDoBtHH5ZvwtcadUx9WzQLTyKAf-4tGFFApPIeTUAHOw3F73xunWrdNZR1iMwLrQZKbjQ==), agriculture, and education.

Ramu Sunkara, Alan CEO, said: “We are excited to bring natural voice to Ionic applications. Users open the application and start a voice conversation as if they are talking to an expert. With this integration, ZeePath is bringing delightful learning experiences to kids, using voice to guide them in academics, fitness, and community.”

Ionic is an application development platform that makes it easy for web developers to build award-winning applications using their existing web skills, enabling them to build apps for iOS, Android, Electron, or Web — from a single, shared codebase. Over five million developers use Ionic, including Airbus, Amtrak, Burger King, Panera Bread, and Southwest Airlines.

“Conversational interfaces are an increasingly important part of any multi-experience app strategy because it gives customers and companies an easy, natural way to interact,” said Max Lynch, co-founder, and CEO of Ionic. “Our partnership with Alan will allow developers to quickly enable voice and AI capabilities in any Ionic app.”
