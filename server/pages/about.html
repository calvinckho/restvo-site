    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p class="lg strong">
      Ionic was founded in 2012, when using web technologies as a means to build
      native apps was still in its infancy. When we started, we just wanted to
      create a better way for web developers to use their existing skillsets to
      build apps for the app stores.
    </p>
    <p class="lg strong">
      Today, Ionic is the world's most popular cross-platform mobile development
      technology stack, powering fast growing startups to some of the biggest
      companies in the world.
    </p>
    <p class="lg light">
      Millions of developers from nearly every industry around the world have
      built millions of mobile apps with Ionic. Our platform allows developers
      to use web technologies to build and deliver high quality apps for mobile
      and desktop, with everything they need from front-end design to continuous
      delivery.
    </p>
    <p class="lg light">
      Ionic not only makes app development easier, faster, and more
      accessible&mdash;it makes it more fun. Mobile is all about finding new
      ways to  change the way humans interact with the world, and we couldn’t
      think of anything more fun than that.

      <h3>Our neck of the woods</h3>
      <p class="lg">
        Ionic was proudly founded and headquartered in beautiful Madison,
        Wisconsin, USA. Located on an isthmus between two lakes, we love being
        able to walk or bike to our office, located in the heart of the downtown
        State Capital.
      </p>
      <p class="lg">
        Although many of us work (and play) in Madison, we also have satellite
        offices in Milwaukee and Boston and a large group of remote workers
        scattered around the United States and Europe.
